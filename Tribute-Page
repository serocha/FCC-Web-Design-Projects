    <p id='img-caption'>Bourdain's bestselling tell-all memoir, <i>Kitchen Confidential</i>, revelled in the seedier aspects of the culinary world. It launched his career as a writer and travel host - and inspired a     generation of cooks and chefs.</p>

    Anthony Bourdain was born on June 25, 1956 in New York City and grew up in Leonia, New Jersey. His father Pierre worked in retail before landing a job as an executive at Columbia Records. Gladys, his mother, was     a staff editor at <i>The New York Times</i>. His paternal grandparents emigrated from France after the First World War.
    <br><br>
    Following high school Anthony worked as a dishwasher at a seafood restaurant while attending Vassar College. Those early years working in kitchens proved influencial to the young Bourdain; the second and third       chapter of his bestseller <i> Kitchen Confidential </i> is largely dedicated to the restaurant's cooks and Bourdain's experiences while working there. He dropped out of university after two years and instead         decided to pursue his education at the Culinary Institute of America where he graduated in 1978.

    <p id='img-caption'>Working as a dishwasher at a local seafood place, Bourdain admired the cooks for their pirate-like appearance and behavior.</p>

    Bourdain moved to New York City and worked his way through a series of kitchens. There he bounced around for a time, navigating a maze of failing restaurants with good pay, a business involved with the mob, and       managing all-convict crew. He married his high school girlfriend Nancy Putkoski in 1985, whom he had first followed to Vassar and then to New York. It was during this time that he developed a heroin addiction and     later described his relationship with Nancy as, "[t]hat kind of love and codependency and sense of adventure — we were criminals together. A lot of our life was built around that, and happily so.” 
    <br><br>
    Brasserie Les Halles, a french brasserie that served classic and traditional French dishes, hired on Bourdain as executive chef in 1998. While working at Les Halles Anthony wrote an expose of the culinary world       in <i>The New Yorker</i> titled, "Don't Eat Before Reading This" which was later expanded into his 1999 memoir, <i>Kitchen Confidential</i>, both showcasing the gritty reality of restaurant life. Despite making       it in the culinary world, it was Bourdain's sharp wit and knack for prose that first propelled him into fame.

    <p id='img-caption'>Bourdain published a cookbook of some of his signature French bistro dishes at Les Halles, including veal short ribs and steak frites, escargots aux noix, and steak tartare.</p>

  <article id='tribute-info'>
    Bourdain continued his success with the publication of his second bestseller in 2001, <i>A Cook's Tour</i>, which detailed traveling the world and trying exotic cuisines. The concept was turned into a travel show     of the same name for The Food Network in 2002, and later refined into the hour-long program <i>Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations</i> which would run from 2005 to 2012. 
    <br><br> 
    Bourdain would go on to guest judge various Food Network programs and launch two more travel series, <i>The Layover</i> and <i>Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown</i>. He won several Emmy Awards for his programs, a       Peabody Award, and was given a degree of Doctor of Humane Letters in Culinary Arts honoris causa by the Culinary Institute of America.

    Anthony Bourdain died in 2018 of an apparent suicide while filming for <i>Parts Unknown</i> in Strasbourg, France. A spontaneous sidewalk memorial was established outside of Brasserie Les Halles in his honor,         decorated with notes from his friends and fans in the culinary world. Restaurants and chefs around the world held tribute dinners and memorials in his name to donate to the <a id="tribute-link"                       href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/" target="_blank">National Suicide Awareness Lifeline</a>.
